# helm-3-crd
A proposal for Helm 3 using CRDs and a custom controller. This README comprises
the proposal for CRDs in Helm 3. In addition to this document, there are other
examples of what the objects will look like contained in this repo.

## Problem Statement
Originally, Helm was built as a way to share reusable components. However, as
its usage has grown, many want to use Helm more as a configuration management
tool. Also, many of the assumptions made when Helm 2 was first released have
not proved true now that Kubernetes has evolved. Below is the list of issues 
current users of Helm 2 face and that can be addressed by this proposal.

- Lack of application lifecycle management
- The current Tiller model does not follow any of the prescribed ways for 
  extending Kubernetes
- Security is difficult and not built in by default. Furthermore, there is no
  easy way to use the current RBAC model for autorization.

## Overview

### The tl;dr version
The following points capture the high level changes compared to Helm 2. Further
details are available in the next subsection.

- State is no longer stored and releases are now diff'd against the current state
  in the cluster.
- Helm will come built in with common lifecycle management patterns and have a
  `Lifecycle` object for registering custom lifecycles 

### Details
TODO

Each lifecycle should be handled by their own controller. We will have a `Lifecycle`
type that specifies its name and what key the controller should watch for.
There will be built in lifecycles that are registered this way and custom ones
can be registered likewise

## Controller Logic
TODO: Flow diagram (or maybe just a list of steps).

- Controller should watch for changes in the `Manifest`, `Value`, or `Secret` 
  specified in the `Release`. It should also watch for changes in the `Release` object
- Tiller will publish a `LifecycleEvent` with the configured `eventKey` for each
  `Lifecycle` specified in a `Release`. It will watch these events until the 
  lifecycle controller responsible for handling that event marks it as done (or
  errored), update the `Release` object, and then delete the event. If it doesn't
  complete after a certain amount of time, the event will be cleaned up and failure
  information added to the `Release` status.
- Any time there is an update to the `Release`, `Manifest`, or `Secret` objects
  specified, it triggers a new rollout and the creation of a new `ReleaseAudit`
  object to track the history of this release

## Open questions
This is a list of open questions that should be resolved before the proposal is
fully accepted. If a larger discussion is needed, we will open an [issue](https://github.com/thomastaylor312/helm-3-crd/issues)
and link it to the question.

- ~Should this be a simple controller or an extension API server? This could allow
  for custom storage backends but would be more difficult to program (and definitely
  harder for users to install). It may be the more robust option~ Just a controller
  for ease of use
- ~Should rendering take place locally or in the controller?~ In the controller
- How should we handle releases that are spread across multiple namespaces?
  Possibly a `ClusterRelease` object that is non-namespaced
- Should the controller enforce the given manifest again if changes are detected
  in the objects created by a release? This could be a feature that is optional
  and can be set by something like `enforce: true` in the `Release`
- With state no longer being stored in a config map, â€‹how do we handle objects
  that should be deleted because they are no longer in the manifests?

## Contributing to the proposal
This is an active proposal and feedback is definitely needed. If you see something
you'd like to change, please open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/thomastaylor312/helm-3-crd/pulls).
We can discuss the change you add and either merge it in or close based on the
outcome of the discussion.
